# Product Classification and Verification
An intelligent machine learning system for classifying products into categories and verifying their features. This project provides a scalable solution for automating product management tasks, ensuring accurate classification and validation in large-scale inventories.



# Features
•	Automated Product Classification: Categorizes products based on their attributes using advanced machine learning algorithms.

•	Feature Verification: Ensures product data adheres to specified standards for accuracy and consistency.

•	Scalable Architecture: Handles large datasets and diverse product categories efficiently.

•	Data-Driven Insights: Offers actionable insights into product categorization and validation results.



How It Works
**1.	Data Preprocessing:**
  o	Cleans and standardizes product data.
  o	Handles missing values and encodes categorical features.
**2.	Feature Engineering:**
  o	Extracts relevant features for classification and verification tasks.
**3.	Machine Learning Models:**
  o	Trains classification models to assign categories.
  o	Validates product data against predefined rules or benchmarks.
**4.	Deployment:**
  o	Provides a user-friendly interface or API for interacting with the system.



# Installation
**1. Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/Malakismail/Product-Classification-and-Verification.git
    cd Product-Classification-and-Verification
**2. Install dependencies:**

    pip install -r requirements.txt


    
# Usage
**1. Prepare your dataset in the required format.**
**2. Train the classification model:**

    python train_model.py --data <path_to_dataset>
**3. Verify product features:**

    python verify_features.py --data <path_to_dataset>
**4. Use the system for real-time classification and verification:**

    python app.py
